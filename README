#### AIF procedure + config for automated ArchLinux installation on virtio using grub2

I use this 'procedure' and 'config' for installing ArchLinux in KVM based virtual machines.
The installation will use grub2 as bootloader. 

I think there are much more simple/clever/clear methods doing this... i hadn't got the time to find them.

Steps:
 1. boot into arch installer
 2. set up network
  optional steps
    a. change root password
    b. start sshd
    c. log into machine, continue with step 3
 3. wget https://raw.github.com/qw3r/aif-stuffs/master/procedures/automatic-grub2 && cp automatic-grub2 /usr/lib/aif/core/procedures
 4. wget https://raw.github.com/qw3r/aif-stuffs/master/configs/arch-on-virtio
 5. aif -p automatic-grub2 -c arch-on-virtio
 6. lean back (or do some real work)
